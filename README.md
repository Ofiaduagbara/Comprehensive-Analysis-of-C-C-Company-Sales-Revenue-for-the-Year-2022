**RECOMMENDATION**

The average sale of "Paseo" which is $163,421.50 isnt totally bad but we can increase the those numbers by growing our geographic reach,
ie expanding physically and maybe online to a new location and equally investing heavily on advert. reevaluate our pricing plan, offer another 
new products and services to your customers and as well discounts. 
All this can equally be applied to the midmarket segment tha has low number of sale, and U.S.A as a country that has the highest number of sales
should maintain or improve its sales by having a good customer relationship, and making goods and services available at all time when needed by 
the customers and equally try to expand to American location that doesnt know about our products and services.
